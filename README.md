This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: forgetting to install testing dependencies before running tests. The original Dockerfile attempts to run unit tests using the `unittest` module, but it fails because the necessary packages are not installed. The solution includes a modified Dockerfile that addresses this issue.  The solution adds a `RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt` command to install the necessary dependencies before running the tests.
